When people at the office think, "Oh, I'd better find someone to write a user interface.", they probably don't think of me first. Recently however, I was asked to write the control, data-acq, and data-reduction code for a spectrometer. The job came with the specification that there should be an easy-to-use graphical interface. Naturally I thought of Python, Matplotlib, and Tkinter.

That project was so much fun that, on my own time, I decided to undertake some small tkinter projects, just to get more practice. This is an easy but fun one. It is intended for the beginning Japanese language student, like me, who wants to learn the two character types called "kana": hiragana, and katakana. I hope that it will be useful for memorization practice and as a reference when reading.  

Update: Thanks @ipekguler for the the awesome additons. I especially love that unintialized buttons now show randomly chosen faces!
